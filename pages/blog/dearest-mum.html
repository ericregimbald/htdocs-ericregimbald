										<p>Dearest MUM,</p>

										<p>Sue Scarlett Regimbald, Susie, Sue, Aunt Sue, Grammie, Wife, Mother, Mum, Ma.
										Sorority Sister, Social Neighbourhood watch captain , Seamstress Sewer, Sweet
										maker,Style dresser, Saber cat carer,Special Botanical planter, Corny Joke Sayer, Pre-
										School teacher Hockey mom…You put all that together what do ya get?.. Busi Sue.
										Self proclaimed as her Email address and license plate would suggest. Let’s Slip into it.
										Sue’s Sweets. A little side business she started. Anyone who knew her, knows that
										baking was a passion. Boy was she great at it! As far back as I can remember, Mum
										baked, made, created every cake for my birthday! Not just mine, but Dad’s cake,
										Brothers and soon commissions would come in, from the neighbours and strangers! If
										you were lucky enough to have one made for you, you’d know they were works of art!
										An Icing squeezer her paint brush, cake pans her canvas: R2 D2, hockey and football
										shaped with little diorama’s on top with scenes and action figures! Not only did they
										look incredible, but you better believe they were delicious. Mum prided herself on tasty
										moist baking. In her zucchini loaf, pie crust, and cookies. If you had treats elsewhere
										they just don’t compare, with their dryness. I missed my mums baking so much living
										in Vancouver that she would send me frozen banana and pumpkin loafs by mail! By the
										time they showed up, thawed and (Chef’s kiss!) Sue’s Sweet treats were in high
										demand. Paramount her chocolate brownies! The famous secret recipe! Never have
										their been a better brownie made before or since, known Province wide: North Bay can
										I get an Amen? And international, Rhode Island I’m looking at you. These were sold to
										coﬀee trucks across Guelph. That’s right She had to hire workers to make sure these
										special squares met the demands. Her employees were made up of hard working
										dedicated mixers, bakers and margarine container replenishers.. Who were they? You
										ask?.. Her 4 boys of course! We got a piece of the pie.</p>

										<p>Mum was the most social person I’ve ever known, Her community reach far and wide.
										Her Pen pal in England since the late 60’s Shirley Day, Her decades long ski friend
										Rosemary, Lifetime Neighbours, Sorority Sisters. She Made friends with the local Disc
										Jockeys: Dave Hannah and Neil Clemons of 90’s C-J-O-Y. (Although I think they were
										in it just for the brownies she brought them come Christmas time). Friends in new
										places of residence: Chartwell, St Luke’s. Friends with My dad’s Ex girlfriends. Just
										when I thought Mum couldn’t make anymore friends, there she was in the Bank telling
										a new friend her life story. Here I thought it was the banking that took hrs. I guess you
										can chalk it up to her gift of the Gab, her ability to listen and retain, although details
										sometimes fuzzy. “Is this a play you’re in?. No Ma a movie, Is this a movie you’re in.?
										No Ma a play. Or perhaps it was simply her Love of people and time to give to
										strangers and family alike.</p>

										<p>A friend of mine sent me a text the other day saying of Sue’s passing. Quote “Your
										Mom was one in a million. Her love and devotion to your Dad, your brothers and you
										was so clear.” It’s true. I’m sure you can ask my siblings how She generated Love and
										generosity. For Me I can count the ways. One: When I filmed the cult classic Nobody’s
										real, I was 13 and couldn’t drive a car, but the characters were adult detectives on a
										stakeout in a Van. Who’s Van? My mums forrest green ford! Mum napped in the back
										as us amateur filmmakers as inexperienced as they come filmed into the night! Thesame could be said for My mum being a supportive audience member, weather it was
										holding mass in my room, an alter boy on this very alter, an actor on stage, Mum was
										always watching with Love and pride in her eyes. Although she made it clear she didn’t
										like when I played a Bad guy..Mum Just you wait and see…</p>

										<p>Mum always had an adventurous spirit! And We benefitted. She would provide me with
										such rich experiences. She seem to have a person for every occasion. I wanted to go
										for a plane ride? Her mechanic had a plane and I went flying. I wanted to play with an
										elaborate train set? She met a guy on the st and we went and conducted mini
										locomotions in his basement. I wanted to play with an AT AT Walker Mum would bring
										me to Johanne Turner’s house. She took me to my first plays: beauty and the beast,
										Oliver Twist! If she couldn’t provide an experience directly, she put us in scouts, she
										sent me to farm camp, ski school Sailing lessons, all of the things that make up who I am is because of
										her. Later in life when Dad wouldn’t join her for things. Mum Made it happen on her
										own, she came out to Vancouver despite having a walker, we got around, we explored.
										It didn’t end there. One of the last moments I saw My Mum on her birthday this past
										September. One of the first things she said without missing a beat. “What are we
										gonna get up to?!” We went for a long wheel around the courtyard as far as we could
										go!..</p>

										<p>I’d be remiss If I didn’t mention the musicality she inspired in my life. Mum had the
										radio on 24 7, 45’s spinning at Christmas. Needless to say it inspired my love of oldies
										and rockin’ roll, and she never silenced me when I sang at the top of my lungs in my
										room. Us as a family were middle class but Mum made sure we never went without.
										We got to try every sport we wanted. Hockey stuck, and Christmases were special for
										all of us. Marc got his GT snow racer, Mike got his goalie pads, Matt got his Gretzky
										Jersey, and I got My Tom jones Tickets. My first concert! With Mum. Later I was happy
										to return the favour and take Mum to Neil Diamond! Last minute call to Mom, she let
										out one of her signature “woohoo!” And Made it to Toronto in a flash!</p>

										<p>Some people Busy themselves with work, others with lonely pursuits. But Mum busied
										herself with worrying about Us, Providing a good a life for us, Documenting our lives,
										keeping every keepsake, every morsel of time, every photograph she took. Every hour
										plus conversation with a stranger at the drugstore! Every garden she planted, every
										sleepless night taking care of Dad and his diabetes, and brownie baking til 2am. She
										busied herself with Laughter. No one laughed harder at her own bad puns than herself.!
										Mum had so much time for others! She gave more than she took. She thought always
										of her grand children, her brother Mose; Her Sister Sandy, Sue’s abundant nieces and
										nephews, the animals and most of all her 4 boys..</p>




									<p>One of the last things that Mum said to me as the core 4 left the room on our last visit
									together. She stopped me as we were leaving and mustered up the strength to say.
									“Eric?..” Ya ma?.. “Will you keep the 4 boys together?..”</p>

									<p>Well Mum in the words of Elvis..</p>

									<p>“There must be lights burning brighter somewhere.. Got to be birds flying higher in a
									sky more blue. If I can dream of a better land where all my brothers walk hand in hand
									tell me why.. oh why …oh why can’t my dream come true….!”</p>

									<p>Lastly; If there was ever a corny joke for this moment that Mum would come up with.. I
									think she would say to you all… “I will never desert you!” (I hear you laughing Mum)</p>

									<p>Say Hi to Dad for us..I will Miss & love you Forever.</p>
