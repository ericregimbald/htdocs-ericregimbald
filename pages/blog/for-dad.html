									<p>Mon Père, Papa Régimbald.</p>
									
									<p>My father Bob was the kind of Dad you see in the climax of of a 90’s movie. Devoted husband,
									He made the championship game, he evened coached. Taught us how to sh, how to build,
									How to ski! He hunted Big game, He trained his dogs to track. He built me a soap box car then
									brought me 2 towns over to race it! He’d name species of birds, animals, “That’s a red wing
									blackbird, A grackle!” “ That a?.. Racoon dad? “No an opossum.” He’d chaperone my school
									trips, Let me climb on the re trucks, Yeah, he was that cool.</p>
									
									<p>He’s also the reason I’m the man I am today. He’d let me know it too, “I sent a boy to
									Vancouver and He’s comes back a man.” It’s hard to pin my dad down because he lived so
									many lives. Even way before me he was Captain of the football team and played Trombone. My
									Dad commanded respect. He was a man of principal. “If anyone makes fun of your last name
									you give em one of these!” (FIST) He was a proud re ghter. He didn’t talk about work a ton,
									but I read about him in the paper. Bob Regimbald carried 4 dogs out of re.” Believe me I
									experienced the best take your kid to work day out of anyone I knew.</p>

									<p>Dad the angler, I accompanied my Dad on many shing trips. On land, Sea or Foam, even Ice.
									Epic shing trips. You know how guys tell stories about the one that got away? Well not us,
									Dad knew how to pin point the exact spot where the sh were with the help of the earliest new
									sonar technology. If they didn’t bite he’d nd the bait that they would. I kid you not we always
									caught the king of the Pond! And Dad would even sometimes catch and release, if it was the
									Big Queen sh. “Leave it for the next guy, she’s full of eggs, let her populate the pond..” Dad
									ever the environmentalist.</p>

									<p>Dad The Hockey Player. There’s nothing that brought our family together more than Hockey.
									Although Dad played hockey before my time, He’d ood the neighbourhood rink so we could
									all play well past the lights shutting o . A devoted Leafs fan, He almost never missed a game…
									both ours and Austin Matthews’.</p>

									<p>Dad The Inventor. Way before Bass Pro Shops, Cabelas stores and Outdoor world. Dad
									needed a Portable ice shack. They weren’t on the market so he built one! You could travel with
									it on skis, which also acted as a sled for the gear. He needed canoe transportation for those
									long portages in Algonquin park. So he built it out of Cooper pipe, welded together and tacked
									on bicycle wheels. I tell ya, Dad if you patented these no less than stellar inventions, You’d be a
									millionaire! Did I mention he also turned down what later became Bob Izumis shing show?!..</p>
									
									<p>He supported me through the tough times of starting out as an actor, paid for my classes,
									watched me on stage in Toronto, Caught me on TV, Even if I wasn’t on TV he’d say. “Now see
									that guy! That can be you you can play that part!” He’d never tried to talk to me out of what
									seemed like a hapless pursuit. Although when I told him recently I was working with Hillary
									Swank on Alaska Daily he Proclaimed: “Working! Right.” Ha ha ha.</p>

									<p>I know My dad was proud of me. He didn’t wait to tell me. He told me everyday we spoke or
									saw me back home. And I was so proud of Him! Being the Captain of group of guys that
									looked to him to lead, for direction, while they had each others backs in a impossible blaze or a
									dangerous rescue. That’s nothing short of courageous.</p>

									<p>While a couple of my brothers know how to build a house, wire up a light, install a toilet like my
									Dad. I never Followed in my dad footsteps. However, I carry his principals in my thinking, I’m
									courageous in my pursuits, I still play hockey, I know my way around a chainsaw, I’m alumberjack, a teacher, a clown, I can sail boat, tie a sherman’s knot, put cologne on when I’m
									in a suit and shoot an arrow… You can’t pin me down. His lessons, his loud laugh, his
									boisterous personality, his humour carries on through his 4 sons, his strength survives through
									My Mom and the lives he’s touched and saved. He’s not lost, the re may be out but his ame
									burns right here in my heart. I will Miss you Dad. But you no longer have to ght, I know you’re
									at peace now. I’ll love you forever.</p>
