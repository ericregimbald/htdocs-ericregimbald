    "notes": "The Italian zombie film Deemed to have saved the Italian film industry. Fulci’s magnum opus is a wonder to behold. This film almost has Bond like elements: exotic locations, globe trotting, Island Layers even a shark scene!. Its beauty is a juxtaposition to the horror on display. It pays homage to so many horror classics, Island of lost souls, Dracula, and of course Romero. But it blends spectacularly and Into a gothic flesh eating epic! I saw this film when I was in my teens working at blockbuster. It was at the beginning of my horror hound fandom adventure. This film blew my mind! And gotta say today it still holds up, in fact I was appreciative of the way it was shot! Not to mention a great score.  The scene stealing locations, literally Fulci did not have permission to shoot on the Brooklyn bridge and he used a tourist helicopter to grab those stunning opening shots of The harbour. Having this knowledge and seeing it as an adult just deepens my appreciation for this masterpiece.",

    "notes": "This Is a real turning point for Keaton and Ron Howard’s career.. Keaton is real funny as he was known in the early 80s, but shows some real heft showing his actor chops with multiple Speeches from the podium before Pacino became known for rousing speeches. Ron Howard handling the comedy ala Night shift but just as well interested in the larger deeper story.. Balancing  the  Race relations of Japan and USA learning from each others cultures and Ultimately finding common ground set in the automobile Manufacturing industry.  It’s a heart warming drama and equally a hilarious comedy. Ahead of its time. A killer 80s soundtrack! Solid supporting turns from Mimi Rogers, John tuturro ,George Wendt,Gedde Watanabe. Keaton in top form! One of his best comedies of the 80s next to Beetlejuice. Would recommend! Facts: 1986 Filmed and takes place in Keaton’s native Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. Known as :Working class Man in Australia. Title song by : Jimmy Barnes",

It’s very Silence of the lambs inspired and directly pulls the Goodbye horses, but you know you’re in for much creepiness when that song drops so it sets an expectation and delivers.  Better than long legs and A bit more palatable to watch Then Henry. It pulls from REFN as well, I’m surprised he’s not a producer. Same director and producer of P2 which I also enjoyed but this has more bite. I’m always curious to see Aja attached projects. As far as Modern horror goes look no further.

    "notes": "Riggs empties his 2nd beretta clip on the helicopter disappearing behind the horizon. Murtaugh: through?. Riggs:  I haven’t even started..This Is the ultimate Buddy cop film. The summer watch you feel sunny LA. At Christmas you feel more that spirit, and the loneliness around the “silly season”. Having Recently watched the directors cut on 4K (which I haven’t seen since VHS and TV. I’d like to review that. At the beginning, you spend more time with the characters in their respective lives. Especially Riggs, the cutting back and fourth from Him to Murtaugh gives you more perspective on who these guys are before they are partnered up. What I love is in this cut it’s both of their movie! I have seen this film more times than I can count and I was hanging on every scene! The dialogue and colours popped. The score pitch perfect and some scenes linger a little longer. When Riggs leaves the Murtaugh residence for the first time. He picks up a hooker to just watch TV with him, it’s bittersweet. As he’s melancholy for the company he just had but he’s not so alone to go back to his place and put a gun to his head. This movie is a product of the 80’s with high octane action and the  buddy formula. But it’s oh so timeless cause of the relationship between the 2 characters and the chemistry between the two leads.  The scene in Murtaugh’s car after Riggs has jumped of the building; how they start to get along through humour and the absurdity of it all is really organic. Each scene is affected  by the  one before it. It’s endlessly rewatchable in every sense of the word.  Shane Black a young screenwriter 22 at the time. Bursting on to the scene with Dick Donner at the helm a director with clout knowing what he had in Black, stayed true to a lot of his script. Then add Joel Silver the big time producer who stills Produces Blacks Work Today (see The Nice Guys). This is one hell of a stew of talent that made an all time classic that spawned a great series! It’s one I’ll return to again and again. Christmas and summer!",

    "notes": "You know what I used to think this was a bad film back in the 90s when I owned it on vhs. But I still loved it on an ironic level. But now Its oddly more prescient, then I could have imagined. Sure it’s an over the top performance from Russell Crowe and it’s far from Denzel’s best. But by jobe it’s so much fun! The action in it is great. The sound design is stellar; something about the bullet sfx just adds hella impact. It’s of mixture of Demoltion man, escape from New York, Terminator all while being a sci fi, horror, and a prison film! For a film with less money it seems to have landed a great cast even if they are just taking a pay check, such as the likes of Louise fletcher. It could be mindless but It’s stimulates to spot the things ahead of its time. Like the president threatening closing the borders to immigration, A villain obsessed with followers, and doing things for the camera with a viewership count ala a livestream..  just to name a few. The score is solid and some good needle drops by Peter Gabriel and the Beegees. This all almagamates into a hodge podge sci fi future Crystal ball product of the 90s Good time! For my money In terms of the Cyber punk entries of the 90s. I’llI take this over Johnny Menemonic any day, even if the B & W version is better. Happy I finally Own this on 4K (Vyn Syn) since my VHS is lost to time.",

He is in the wraparound story, and I appreciated the new direction they went with.That was most likely  the highlight. The first story was the creepiest and strongest.The rest were middling to ok.

The evil that men do.  His PTSD has caught up with him. This movie is very contained, very grounded and very realistic. Most of the films is made up of strong scenes almost as set pieces as it is based on a play. It unfolds through scenes of interrogation, but very one different and more grilling than the last. It’s steeped  in 70s cop genre grimness that Lumet does so well. This one dare I say is as good if not better then Serpico. However Pacino’s Serpico you can root for him standing up to the injustice. Connery’s Det  Johnson is a man coming apart from the inside out. It’s a tough watch but oh so engaging.",

The gags still hit, and a couple lines are lol knee slapper funny. While it sends up The source material, Brooks films have a respect and affection and can be firmly categorized in the genre they’re poking fun at.
